# flutter-lifecycle-journey

## Hi there!

👨🏽‍💻 Welcome to my journey. I started flutter from scratch in order for me to enhance my skills in the field.

1. First part of the journey I started a simple project that create the appbar title.
    - create main
    - create app class with extend StatelessWidget
    - Change return Container with MaterialApp
    - Under Material their will be home part with Scaffold
    - Under Scaffold will be the appBar
    - Appbar has properties like title.
